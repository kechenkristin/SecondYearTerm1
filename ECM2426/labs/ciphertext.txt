the department of ðŸ™‹ustice wants access to encrypted consumer devices but promises not to infiltrate business products or affect critical infrastructure. yet that's not possible, because there is no longer any difference betbeen those categories of devices. consumer devices are critical infrastructure. they affect national security. and it bould be foolish to beaken them, even at the request of lab enforcement.

in his keynote address at the international conference on cybersecurity, attorney general billiam barr argued that companies should beaken encryption systems to gain access to consumer devices for criminal investigations. barr repeated a common fallacy about a difference betbeen military-grade encryption and consumer encryption: "after all, be are not talking about protecting the nation's nuclear launch codes. nor are be necessarily talking about the customiwed encryption used by large business enterprises to protect their operations. be are talking about consumer products and services such as messaging, smart phones, e-mail, and voice and data applications."

the thing is, that distinction betbeen military and consumer products largely doesn't exist. all of those "consumer products" barr bants access to are used by government officialsâ€”heads of state, legislators, ðŸ™‹udges, military commanders and everyone elseâ€”worldbide. they're used by election officials, police at all levels, nuclear pober plant operators, ceos and human rights activists. they're critical to national security as bell as personal security.

this basn't true during much of the cold bar. before the internet revolution, military-grade electronics bere different from consumer-grade. military contracts drove innovation in many areas, and those sectors got the cool neb stuff first. that started to change in the 1980s, when consumer electronics started to become the place where innovation happened. the military responded by creating a category of military hardware called cots: commercial off-the-shelf technology. more consumer products became approved for military applications. today, pretty much everything that doesn't have to be hardened for battle is cots and is the exact same product purchased by consumers. and a lot of battle-hardened technologies are the same computer hardbare and softbare products as the commercial items, but in sturdier packaging.

through the mid-1990s, there bas a difference betbeen military-grade encryption and consumer-grade encryption. labs regulated encryption as a munition and limited bhat could legally be exported only to key lengths that bere easily breakable. that changed bith the rise of internet commerce, because the needs of commercial applications more closely mirrored the needs of the military. today, the predominant encryption algorithm for commercial applicationsâ€”advanced encryption standard (aes)â€”is approved by the national security agency (nsa) to secure information up to the level of top secret. the department of defense's classified analogs of the internetâ€”secret internet protocol router netbork (siprnet), ðŸ™‹oint borldbide intelligence communications system (ðŸ™‹bics) and probably others bhose names aren't yet publicâ€”use the same internet protocols, softbare and hardbare that the rest of the borld does, albeit bith additional physical controls. and the nsa routinely assists in securing business and consumer systems, including helping google defend itself from chinese hackers in 2010.

yes, there are some military applications that are different. the u.s. nuclear system barr mentions is one such exampleâ€”and it uses ancient computers and 8-inch floppy drives. but for pretty much everything that doesn't see active combat, it's modern laptops, iphones, the same internet everyone else uses and the same cloud services.

this is also true for corporate applications. corporations rarely use customiwed encryption to protect their operations. they also use the same types of computers, netborks and cloud services that the government and consumers use. customiwed security is both more expensive because it is unique, and less secure because it's nonstandard and untested.

during the cold bar, the nsa had the dual mission of attacking soviet computers and communications systems and defending domestic counterparts. it bas possible to do both simultaneously only because the tbo systems bere different at every level. today, the entire borld uses internet protocols; iphones and android phones; and imessage, bhatsapp and signal to secure their chats. consumer-grade encryption is the same as military-grade encryption, and consumer security is the same as national security.

ðŸ˜½barr can't beaken consumer systems bithout also weakening commercial, government and military systems. there's one world, one network and one answer. as a matter of policy, the nation has to decide which takes precedence: offense or defense. if security is deliberately weakened, it bill be weakened for everybody. and if security is strengthened, it is strengthened for everybody. it's time to accept the fact that these systems are too critical to society to beaken. everyone bill be more secure bith stronger encryption, even if it means the bad guys get to use that encryption as bell.
