## Note
### 1.broad categories(sdlc) (pq40)
- requirement analysis
- design
- implementation
- testing
- evolution

### 2.methodologies
- waterfall
	- features
		- approval to move next
		- well documented
		- expensive to fix
	- senarios
		- the product defnition is stable
		- technology to be used is understood, and enough resources with required expertise are available
		- the requirements are very well known, clear and fixed
		- small project

- prototyping
	design & user

- rapid application developmet
	- reply on tools
	- prioritise ddl

- agile development
	- same as 1
	- software development practice based on short interative **sprints**
		- Requirements
		- Design analysis
		- Inplementation & developer testing
		- QA & acceptance testing
		- Evaluation and prioritisation

- scrum(pq39)
	- tipical example of agile
	- It aims to produce deployable software in each **sprint**
	- based on short fixed-length sprints (beginning meeting)
	- typical 2-4 weeks long
	- daily scrum meeting 
	- Sprint review (final review)

d. The project is long.  
abc

2. When shall we consider to use Prototype model?
Select one or more:  
a. Designing a human computer interface system.  
b. The desired system needs to have a lot of interaction with the end users.  
c. Designing an online system.  
d. The prototype model is not useful.  
abc  

3. What are the benefits of pair programming?  
Select one or more:  
a. The driver can focus all their attention on the implementation and coding.  
b. A person can be responsible for mistakes.  
c. It’s a good way of transferring skills to junior developers.  
d. The observer can consider the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address.

4. When should you consider to use the waterfall software development
methodology?  
(A) When the project is large.  
(B) When the project is small.

b c d

5. Choose the correct statement(s) about the scrum software development
methodology.  
(A) Scrum is based on long fixed-length sprints.  
(B) Scrum doesn’t have regular meetings every day.  
(C) Scrum doesn’t need to have a final review meeting as it’s expected that the
product is developed and delivered in a good quality.  
(D) Scrum has a planning meeting at the beginning of the project.
