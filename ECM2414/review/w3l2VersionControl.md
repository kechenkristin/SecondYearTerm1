## Exercise
1. Choose the correct statement of version control from the below. Select one or more:  
a. Class files of Java programs need to be stored in the version control system.  
b. Version control can be a centralised system, or a distributed system.  
c. Version control is a fundamental tool in modern software development, with which you can go back to previous states of your development, so it provides a project-wide undo button.  
d. Version control allows you to see who has done what and make it much easier to deal with some surprising code.  

2. Choose the correct statement(s) of version control from the below. Select one or more:  
a. In distributed version control, each user gets his or her own repository and working copy. After you commit, others have no access to your changes until you push your changes to the central repository. When you update, you do not get others' changes unless you have first pulled those changes into your repository.  
b. In centralised version control, each user gets his or her own working copy, but there is just one central repository. As soon as you commit, it is possible for your co-workers to update and to see your changes.  
c. Forking and branching are exactly the same.  
d. Everything you need if your local machines died need to be stored in the version control system.  
a, b, d

3. Choose the correct statement(s) about the good practice of using version control from the below. Select one or more:  
a. I don't have to change the file name through the version control system.  
b. The version control is not only used for code, but it can also used for other types of files like images.  
c. If you have direct access to the server and directory where your repository is being stored, you can theoretically use like terminal in Linux to copying and moving files. If you start doing this, you against version control system. If you use your own command in a version control directory and delete the file using that, the file is there in the version control system because you donâ€™t use version control system to delete the file.  
d. If you have multiple projects, you should have distinct directory in the repository for each projec  
b, c, d  

4. Choose the correct statement(s) about the good practice of using version control.  
(A) Along with the use of version control systems, you can still use the Linux terminal for copying and moving files.  
(B) If you have multiple projects, you should have distinct directory in the repository for each project.  
(C) Version control can be used for assets such as images and sound files as well as repository for each project.  
(D) You don't have to change the file name using the version control system.  
b, c
