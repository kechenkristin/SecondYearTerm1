## note
### File-based approach
- Advantages
	- User Control
	- Applications and data file can be optimised for particular tasks
- Disadvantages
	- Data Duplication
	- Data Dependence
	- Incompatible file formats
	- Fixed queries/proliferation of application programs (APPS)

### DBMS
- functionalities
	- Data storage management
	- Data access and application programming interface
	- A system catalog
	- Data communication interfaces
	- Integrity services
	- Transaction management
	- Concurrency control services
	- Backup and recovery services
	- Autorization/security management
- Advantages
	- Control of data redundancy
	- Data Consistency
	- Sharing of Data
	- Improved data integrity
	- Improved Security
	- Enforcement of Standards
	- Economy of Scale
	- Balance of conflicting requirements
	- Improved data accessibility and responsiveness
	- Increased Productivity
	- Improved maintenance through data independence
	- Increased concurrency
	- Backup and Recovery services
- Disadvantages
	- Complexity
	- Size
	- Cost of DBMS
	- Cost of conversion
	- Performance
	- Great impact of failure
